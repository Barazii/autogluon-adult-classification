1. Gluon part of apache and has been discontinued, autogluon part of AWS.\
2. When send data from a model container to another, encode data. When receive data from a container, decode data.\
3. When using transform job, the encoding/decoding before placing the results in csv file is auto done by sagemaker server.\
4. In data pre processing, showing counts of values of columns (in a jupyter notebook) is super good (because MS data wrangler doesn't show all values of a column, only most frequent 3 values).\
5. Good practice to build the machine learning model in jupyter notebook first for faster prototyping before making files, scripts and good structure for the project.
